## Real-world data to build explainable trustworthy artificial intelligence models for NSCLC efficacy in patients treated with immune-based therapy

Codes in this repository are used for our lates publication [Real-world data to build explainable trustworthy artificial intelligence models for prediction of immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC patients](https://www.frontiersin.org/my-frontiers/overview). 

*Data_splitting.py* - Splits the data into test and training set, and finds the correlation in features

*Catboost_model_development.py* - Is the development of the CatBoost model (with Grid search) for prediction of IO efficacy in patient with advanced NSCLC using Real-World data.
