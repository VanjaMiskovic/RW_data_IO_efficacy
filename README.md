## Real-world data to build explainable trustworthy artificial intelligence models for NSCLC efficacy in patients treated with immune-based therapy

Codes in this repository are used for our lates publication [Real-world data to build explainable trustworthy artificial intelligence models for NSCLC efficacy in patients treated with immune-based therapy](https://www.frontiersin.org/my-frontiers/overview). 

Data_splitting - Splits the data into test and training set, and finds the correlation in features

Catboost_model_development - Is the development of the CatBoost model (with Grid search) for prediction of IO efficacy in patient with advanced NSCLC using Real-World data.
